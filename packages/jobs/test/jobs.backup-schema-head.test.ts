/**
 * `jobs.backup-schema-head` — a backup taken from a fully-migrated jobs store must be
 * verifiable by the SAME binary (ledger-backup-contract §8.3 compatibility).
 *
 * Regression: `@atlas/jobs` owns `0002_jobs` + `0007_job_cancellations`, but
 * `@atlas/sqlite-store` cannot import their ids (it does not depend on `@atlas/jobs` —
 * that would be a dependency cycle), so its static `KNOWN_SCHEMA_HEADS` did not contain
 * them. Once the jobs migrations were applied one of them became the schema HEAD, every
 * subsequent backup was stamped with it, and `verifyBackup` rejected the binary's OWN
 * backups as a "future/unknown schema" — making the ledger unrestorable. The owning
 * package now declares its heads via `registerKnownSchemaHead` alongside its migrations
 * (the same composition-root seam as `registerMigration`).
 *
 * Since task 3-4 the core `0013_links_v2` (in `openStore`'s default set) is the
 * lexicographically-highest applied migration, so IT — not a jobs head — is the schema
 * HEAD of a freshly-migrated store, and every new backup stamps `0013_links_v2`. The
 * jobs-head `registerKnownSchemaHead` calls still matter for backward-compatibility with
 * backups taken BEFORE `0013` existed (stamped `0007_job_cancellations`) — that seam is
 * still exercised on every `openJobsStore`. This test asserts the core §8.3 guarantee:
 * the binary VERIFIES its own freshly-taken backup (head recognized, not future/unknown).
